# Minecraft-World-Creation
A Minecraft game plugin that can generate different terrains according to user descriptions, combining PCG algorithm and NLP.

# Scope
The idea behind this project is the creation of a game world in Minecraft that functions like a black box. It is by definition created by a seed, which is an integer number. For example, "seed 42". However, this process brings uncertainty and misunderstanding of how the world actually is, as people can not imagine a world just with a number, even for hardcore players. Therefore, a plugin can take in the descriptive sentences input by players and then generate a game world accordingly. This will make the entire process more understandable and transparent.
